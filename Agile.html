                      <p>
                        Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches. Instead of betting everything on a "big bang" launch, an agile team delivers work in small, but consumable, increments. Requirements, plans, and results are evaluated continuously so teams have a natural mechanism for responding to change quickly.
                        </p>  
                      <p ><h1>Is the Agile Manifesto still a thing?</h1></p>
                      <p> 

                        Standing amidst the technological revolution, we find ourselves asking if the Agile Manifesto should still be our guide as we move into a world defined by continuous innovation. This short, but game-changing document helped take us from shipping products like they were cargo on boats to same-day delivery by drone. But today, we're less pioneers, and more like explorers on the seas of continuous improvement, which makes us wonder, is it time to improve the Manifesto, too?</p>
                      <h2 id="feature">Feature flagging or feature toggling</h2>
                      <p>This is a practice which enables ‘soft releases’ of new code. Before feature flagging, teams would push entire features out to all production users as part of a regular code release. Feature flagging reduces the risk for deployments by allowing safe validation of features in a production environment before exposing them live to all live customers. Once a feature flag rollout has been successfully, privately, validated it can be rapidly rolled out and change live customer experience.</p>
                      <h2>Microservices</h2>
                      <p>Many modern networked applications have adopted a Microservices architecture (MSA) infrastructure. MSA is a distributed network architecture that enables horizontally scaling and network redundancy. A microservice implementation will break an application in to separate deployments that correspond to business needs. Some examples of these business needs are: payments, authentication, and analytics.</p>
                      <h2>Functional programming – formally verified software</h2>
                      <p>A reemergence of lost and under utilized functional programing paradigms from the last century is underway. A new generation of developers are rediscovering languages like Ocaml, Haskell, and Lisp.  Discussions are being had about mistakes in language design. Discussions like maybe Object Oriented Programming was a mistake.

                        Organizations are finding that higher quality, well designed, user empathetic programing languages can lay a foundation for higher quality, well designed user empathetic business product output. Functional languages can provide these higher quality offerings with features that lower the cognitive overhead of developers interacting and maintaining a code base. This leads to less bugs and higher quality software.
                        
                        Formal verification is the process of proving or disproving the correctness of algorithms in an underlying system. It can be thought of as a mathematical process like verifying an algebraic expression. A formal property specification is provided for the algorithms implementation, and methods like static analysis can be used to prove the correctness of the implementation. 
                        
                        From the idea of formal verification comes the radical idea that—maybe—code can write itself. Given a well designed up front formal business domain type specification and a soundly typed language. Generative tools can be used to write a code base that matches the formal specification. Languages like idris, coq, agda are exploring these ideas.</p>

        What is Agile Development?
        Software development comprises various approaches to software development under which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams and their customer(s) or end user(s).

        What is Srum?
        Scrum is a framework that helps teams work together. Much like a rugby team (where it gets its name) training for the big game, Scrum encourages teams to learn through experiences, self-organize while working on a problem, and reflect on their wins and losses to continuously improve.
        
        Where does Agile and Scrum intersect?
        Sprints help teams follow the agile principle of "delivering working software frequently," as well as live the agile value of "responding to change over following a plan." The scrum values of transparency, inspection, and adaptation are complementary to agile and central to the concept of sprints.
        
        Advantages of Agile Methodology:
        In Agile methodology the delivery of software is unremitting.
        The customers are satisfied because after every Sprint working feature of the software is delivered to them.
        Customers can have a look of the working feature which fulfilled their expectations.
        If the customers has any feedback or any change in the feature then it can be accommodated in the current release of the product.
        In Agile methodology the daily interactions are required between the business people and the developers.
        In this methodology attention is paid to the good design of the product.
        Changes in the requirements are accepted even in the later stages of the development.
        Disadvantages of the Agile Methodology
        In Agile methodology the documentation is less.
        Sometimes in Agile methodology the requirement is not very clear hence it’s difficult to predict the expected result.
        In few of the projects at the starting of the software development life cycle it’s difficult to estimate the actual effort required.
        The projects following the Agile methodology may have to face some unknown risks which can affect the development of the project.
        Examples of Agile methodology frameworks:
        Scrum
        Kanban
        Extreme Programming (XP)
        Adaptive Project Framework (APF)
        What is Scrum
        Scrum is a framework that helps teams work together. Much like a rugby team (where it gets its name) training for the big game, Scrum encourages teams to learn through experiences, self-organize while working on a problem, and reflect on their wins and losses to continuously improve. While the Scrum I’m talking about is most frequently used by software development teams, its principles and lessons can be applied to all kinds of teamwork. This is one of the reasons Scrum is so popular. Often thought of as an agile project management framework, Scrum describes a set of meetings, tools, and roles that work in concert to help teams structure and manage their work.

        Differences Between Srum and Kanban
        Scrum	Kanban
        Regular fixed length sprints (ie, 2 weeks)	Continuous flow
        At the end of each sprint	Continuous delivery
        Product owner, scrum master, development team	No required roles
        Velocity	Lead time, cycle time, WIP
        Teams should not make changes during the sprint.	Change can happen at any time

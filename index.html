                    <h1 id="future"> What is Software Development</h1>
                      <p>Software is everywhere these days: phones, TVs, cars, vending machines, coffee makers, and pet toys all offer some software driven features. All of these products have been created by groups of people that have organized with the goal of making electronic signals behave in a desirable pattern. In short, software development is the overall process involved when taking a software project from conception to production delivery.

                        This process encompases the design, documentation, programming, testing and ongoing maintenance of a software deliverable. These various aspects are used to create a workflow pipeline, a sequence of steps that when followed produce high quality software deliverables. This pipeline is known as the Software Development Lifecycle.
                        
                        The art of software development has many deep schools of thought. The following discussion is not a comprehensive guide, but a overview of the most recognized techniques. Software development today is generally executed with a complementary agile project management process. This process is in-effect during steps 3 and 4 from the Software Development Lifecycle.
                        
                        A regular planning period is conducted in which expectations are set, dependencies are addressed and tasks defined. The tasks are executed and adjusted during a sprint period. During the sprint period these tasks are updated as they progress to completion. Specialized organizational software for task tracking, like Jira, is used to monitor the state of individual task within a holistic sprint view.</p>  
                      <p ><h1> The future of Software Development</h1></p>
                      <p>The immediate future of software development is directed by a few core values: automation, transparency, and democratization. Overall these trends are lowering the costs required to develop new projects and lowering the barrier to entry for non-technical team members to contribute to software development. 

                        The following practices have been adopted by some of the most successful enterprise software companies. Understanding how your team can use these practices to increase the speed of development can lead to a competitive advantage. These are the trends and practices that are enabling software companies to execute next level vision and delivery of product.</p>
                      <h2 id="feature">Feature flagging or feature toggling</h2>
                      <p>This is a practice which enables ‘soft releases’ of new code. Before feature flagging, teams would push entire features out to all production users as part of a regular code release. Feature flagging reduces the risk for deployments by allowing safe validation of features in a production environment before exposing them live to all live customers. Once a feature flag rollout has been successfully, privately, validated it can be rapidly rolled out and change live customer experience.</p>
                      <h2>Microservices</h2>
                      <p>Many modern networked applications have adopted a Microservices architecture (MSA) infrastructure. MSA is a distributed network architecture that enables horizontally scaling and network redundancy. A microservice implementation will break an application in to separate deployments that correspond to business needs. Some examples of these business needs are: payments, authentication, and analytics.</p>
                      <h2>Functional programming – formally verified software</h2>
                      <p>A reemergence of lost and under utilized functional programing paradigms from the last century is underway. A new generation of developers are rediscovering languages like Ocaml, Haskell, and Lisp.  Discussions are being had about mistakes in language design. Discussions like maybe Object Oriented Programming was a mistake.

                        Organizations are finding that higher quality, well designed, user empathetic programing languages can lay a foundation for higher quality, well designed user empathetic business product output. Functional languages can provide these higher quality offerings with features that lower the cognitive overhead of developers interacting and maintaining a code base. This leads to less bugs and higher quality software.
                        
                        Formal verification is the process of proving or disproving the correctness of algorithms in an underlying system. It can be thought of as a mathematical process like verifying an algebraic expression. A formal property specification is provided for the algorithms implementation, and methods like static analysis can be used to prove the correctness of the implementation. 
                        
                        From the idea of formal verification comes the radical idea that—maybe—code can write itself. Given a well designed up front formal business domain type specification and a soundly typed language. Generative tools can be used to write a code base that matches the formal specification. Languages like idris, coq, agda are exploring these ideas.</p>
